        Joseph is one of the most thoughtful and hardworking engineers I have met and consistently
        goes above and beyond to move the team forward. His uniquely strong combination of creative
        problem solving, project planning, and collaboration skills were key to our team&apos;s
        success. His consistently upbeat and positive attitude made him a pleasure to work with and
        had a tremendous impact on the group&apos;s morale. Joseph&apos;s dedication and passion for
        engineering will make him a great addition to any team.

        Joseph is a laser focussed and very talented engineer who has a knack for asking the right
        questions. His presence on a team ensures that decisions are being made for the right
        reasons, and he consistently demonstrates leadership by making sure that the team is aligned
        and moving toward a common goal. He exhibits strong competencies across the stack and in
        particular showed a firm command of the Flux paradigm in React through seamlessly
        integrating new components to the existing state management and component structure of our
        application.

        Joseph was an absolute pleasure to work with, his immaculate attention to detail and
        constant positive energy made our development environment incredibly positive, and kept our
        spirits up during difficult debugging sessions. Joe is a solid professional whose passion
        for Javascript goes above and beyond average engineers, and I can say with confidence that
        he has taught me so much about being an engineer that not only excels technically but also
        compassionately.
